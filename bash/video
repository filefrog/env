# This source-able file defines a function
# called `take` that does some video signalling
# to make life easier when recording and trying
# to find the marks BETWEEN takes.
#
# To use it, start recording in a new shell.
# When things go pear-shaped, run `take`.
#
# Requires figlet (brew install figlet)
